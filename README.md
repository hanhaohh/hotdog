# Hearst Connect AI 101 Workshop(Hearst Machine Learning Group)

Inspired by Hotdog and not hotdog mobile application in HBO's Silicon Valley show, We decided to make our own Hotdog classification web application. This is a fun, simple application, but we think it covers almost every aspect of building an end-to-end deep learning/ machine learning application. We hope you enjoy it.

# Project Structure

- images(images used in notebook)
- app(Flask application which loads the hotdog model and predict the probability of an uploaded image being a hotdog)
- hotdog.py (Python file which processes images, eg: load images, rotate images, etc.)
- hotdog_application.ipynb(Jupyter notebook to produce the hotdog classification model)
- model.h5 (hotdog classification model produced during the workshop)
- prediction.ipynb(Jupyter notebook to make prediction)
- train_set(training images for building the model, if you want to classify something else like(if house or ranch), just replace the `hodog`, `nothotdog` folders with images of house and ranch. Also,  don't forget to modify the path of new images when you try to load images)
